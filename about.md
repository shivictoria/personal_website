## What I Do

My current career trajectory is tending towards leveraging technology and science to improve the lives of those living with neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. 

I like projects that are interdiscplinary, challenge me, allow me to dive deeper into humanity, and to meet and work with brilliant people along the way. 

- **Neuroscience**: EEG signal processing, neural network modelling (Mostly dry-lab. Offers to teach me wet-lab skills are greatly appreciated!)
- **Clinical**: Polysomnography/EEG/stereo-EEG data collection, sEEG stimulation
- **Software & Computer Science**: Python, C#, MATLAB, deep learning, reinforcement learning, Unity
- **Tools & Technologies**: Git, synchronising data streams, Arduino

## Why I Do It
Life is the most precious resource we are given. 

I am here to experience as much life as I can, and to ensure others get to live the lives they want to. 

I believe in strength in diversity.
