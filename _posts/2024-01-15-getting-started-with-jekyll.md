# Getting Started with Jekyll

Jekyll is a fantastic static site generator that's perfect for blogs, documentation sites, and personal websites. In this post, I'll walk you through the basics of getting started with Jekyll.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. It takes your content written in Markdown, processes it through templates, and generates a complete static website that you can deploy anywhere.

## Why Choose Jekyll?

- **Simple**: Write in Markdown, Jekyll handles the rest
- **Fast**: Static sites load quickly
- **Secure**: No database or server-side code to worry about
- **Free hosting**: GitHub Pages supports Jekyll natively
- **Version control**: Your entire site is in Git

## Setting Up Your First Jekyll Site

### Prerequisites

1. Install Ruby (version 2.5 or higher)
2. Install Jekyll and Bundler:
   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

### Create a New Site

```bash
jekyll new my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Basic Structure

A typical Jekyll site has this structure:

```
my-awesome-site/
├── _posts/          # Blog posts
├── _layouts/        # HTML templates
├── _includes/       # Reusable components
├── _config.yml      # Site configuration
├── assets/          # CSS, JS, images
└── index.html       # Homepage
```

## Writing Your First Post

Create a new file in `_posts/` with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "My First Post"
date: 2024-01-15
categories: [general]
---

Your content goes here...
```

## Customizing Your Site

The `_config.yml` file controls your site's settings:

```yaml
title: My Awesome Site
email: your-email@example.com
description: >-
  Write an awesome description for your new site here.
baseurl: ""
url: "https://your-domain.com"
```

## Themes

Jekyll has a great theme system. You can use existing themes or create your own. The Hyde theme (which this site uses) is a popular choice for personal blogs.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy a Jekyll site is with GitHub Pages:

1. Push your site to a GitHub repository
2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Select your source branch
4. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

## Next Steps

- Customize your theme
- Add categories and tags
- Set up a custom domain
- Add analytics
- Optimize for SEO

Jekyll is a powerful tool that makes creating and maintaining a website simple and enjoyable. Whether you're a developer looking to blog about your work or someone wanting to share their thoughts online, Jekyll provides a solid foundation.

Happy blogging!
