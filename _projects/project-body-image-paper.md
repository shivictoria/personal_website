## Overview
Employed a mixed-method qualitative analysis approach to integrate cultural, social and digital implications on body image dissatisfaction psychopathy.

## Role & Responsibilities
- Analysed content of top 100 videos for three trends on Douyin
- Used Nvivo for semantic analysis of top comments of those videos
- Writing, formal analyses, investigation, review and editing

## Highlights
- Published in *Journal of Eating Disorders* [Chinese TikTok (Douyin) challenges and body image concerns: a pilot study](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00829-5)
- Presented at *2021 Body Image & Related Disorders* and *2022 International Conference on Eating Disorders* (both remote due to COVID)

## What I Learned
- How to work asynchornously over zoom (thanks COVID), and over timezones (my dear colleague Shuchen was in New York the whole time!)
- How to write great minutes and actionables, thanks Jasmine!
- To always have time for your team, our supervisor Dr. Krug had three boys under 5, yet still devoted her full attention to us.
